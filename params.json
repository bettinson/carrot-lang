Use file extension `.html.crt` and run `preprocessor.rb` to use it.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nEmbed carrot in html between `{{ }}`. Note, this does not work at all yet. Like, not even a little bit.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<body>\r\n  {{ name=\"Matt\" }}\r\n  <p>Hi, This is {{ name }}'s website.</p>\r\n\r\n  {{ photos }}\r\n  <image>{{ photo.path }}</image>\r\n  {{ photos }}\r\n</body>\r\n```\r\n",
